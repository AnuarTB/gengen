## Developer guide

**NOTE**: the version of python for development is 3.6+

If you want to test or/and show others the usage of your code, then you are more welcome to write unittests.
For reference you can see generic_test.py. We use unittest module and to execute tests you can just run:

**Test execution(example)**
```
python -m unittest -v generic_test.py
```
